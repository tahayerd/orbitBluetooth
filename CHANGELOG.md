# Changelog

All notable changes to Orbit Bluetooth are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Unreleased

### Documentation

- Troubleshooting: after an update that adds files (1.13.3 added `OrbitIpc.qml` and `PairingFlow.qml`), restart DMS once. Qt keeps the list of a folder's QML files for as long as the shell runs, so the new files are not found, Orbit's daemon does not start, and DMS's own volume OSD shows instead of Orbit's pop-up.

## 1.13.3 - 2026-10-04

### Changed

- Code only, nothing changes on screen: the hit test that tells which device is under a point moved from `OrbitScene` (404 → 393 lines) to `OrbitWorld`, which owns the devices.
- The daemon's `dms ipc call orbitBluetooth` commands moved into `components/common/OrbitIpc.qml`. No behaviour change.
- Internal: the noise-control service's snapshot merging moved to `AncSnapshot.js` (pure, tested); no behaviour change.
- The pairing steps of the new-device pop-up (pair, key-press check, connect, time-out, demo script) moved out of `NewDeviceWatch.qml` into `PairingFlow.qml`. No behaviour change.

### Fixed

- The DMS journal no longer fills with a QML warning ("depends on non-bindable properties") each time the Dank Island opens its volume face. The island's click-away layer is now looked up once, when the face first holds it, instead of through a binding on a list that cannot be bound. Nothing changes on screen. The lookup lives in `ClickAwayHold` (one role: that layer), and an unused import is gone from `IslandFace`.

## 1.13.2 - 2026-10-04

### Changed

- **The wheel changes the level you point at.** On the two volumes' screen (the card, the pop-up), scrolling over a half circle, the icon at its foot or its percentage changes that level, the device's or this PC's; between the half circles the nearer one takes it, and beside them the left percentage is the device's and the right one this PC's. Before, only the half circle itself counted and everything else changed the device. The level you scroll lights up (its moon grows, its percentage shines). A half notch left over from one level no longer counts toward the other.

## 1.13.1 - 2026-10-04

### Changed

- **The Dank Island keeps its own spring.** Orbit no longer forces the island to follow the volume keys without its motion (1.13.0 did, in memory): it grows out of its pill and folds back with DMS's own spring and fades, as your DMS settings decide (*Settings → Dank Island → Reduce Motion*, or the global *Reduce Motion* and animation speed). Only DMS's full-screen click-away layer is still hidden while the face is up. The motion costs shell time: one volume step up then one down, measured with music playing, went from 54 % of a core at its busiest second (3.4 % of the machine, 2.4 core-seconds over 16 s) to 186–197 % (about 12 %, 8 core-seconds). Turn *Reduce Motion* on in DMS to get the light behaviour back.
- **One volume pop-up, and it is Orbit's.** While the pop-up is on (any choice but *Off*), DMS's own volume OSD, and the volume face its Dank Island opens by itself, are switched off: nothing shows before or under Orbit's pop-up any more. The switch is held in memory only and given back when Orbit stops, when the plugin is turned off or when the pop-up is *Off*. DMS saves all of its settings together, so Orbit lets go of the switch for a quarter of a second around each of DMS's own saves: DMS's file keeps your own *Volume* value, and removing Orbit leaves nothing behind. In *Settings → Sound → Pop-up* the first choice is now called *In the Dank Island* (still the default; a screen without an island gets the pop-up where DMS's OSD would show).

## 1.13.0 - 2026-10-04

### Added

- **What really plays.** Under a device's name on its card, and in the volume pop-up for any output, one short line says what the sound is: how it is connected (Bluetooth, USB, HDMI, S/PDIF, analog), the codec (LDAC, AAC, aptX HD, SBC...), the sample rate and the bit depth, for example *Bluetooth · LDAC · 96 kHz · 24 bit*. A small info button unfolds the rest: channels, and a note when this PC resamples on the way to the device. *Settings → Sound → Audio details* chooses, fact by fact, what shows on the line and what shows when unfolded. It is read from PipeWire (`pactl`) only while the card or the pop-up is on screen; nothing runs otherwise, and nothing leaves the PC.

### Fixed

- A failed pairing no longer writes the error text to the journal (it can carry a device name or address): the journal gets a fixed line with the step that failed; the text still shows on the pairing sheet.

### Changed

- **Lighter volume keys on a Dank Island.** While Orbit's face is up, the island follows the keys at once (no spring, no cross-fade) and DMS's full-screen click-away layer is hidden; both are given back when the keys stop. The visualizer's `cava` only starts 700 ms after the last key, so a burst of steps does not pay its start-up cost. All in memory: no setting of DMS is written.
- *Visualizer motion* now defaults to *Light* (30 images per second); *Smooth* (60) stays one click away in *Settings → Sound*.
- **Each rule lives in one place.** A Bluetooth address and the BlueZ path built from it are checked by one pure, tested `common/Address.js` (the volume code, the keyboard-profile check and the battery bookkeeping each had their own copy), and the four copies of "plugin file → path" are DMS's own `Paths.strip`. The BlueZ adapter number is now capped at three digits everywhere, as it already was for the keyboard-profile check.
- **The pairing sheet is five readable parts instead of one 845-line file.** `PairingSheet.qml` keeps the card, its keys and its settings; the colours of the two skins (`PairingSkin`, `PictureColor`), the clock and entrance (`PairingMotion`), the scene (`PairingSky`, `PairingPlanet`) and the status strip (`PairingHeader`) each have their own file. Renders are identical.
- **The volume scope is four short files instead of one 373-line file.** `PolarScope.qml` keeps the geometry, the easing and the picture; the half circles (`PolarArcs`), the knobs (`PolarMoons`) and the gestures (`PolarGestures`) each have their own. Same pictures (compared with the offscreen previews), same behaviour.
- **The scene is a hub of 404 lines instead of 586.** `OrbitScene.qml` keeps the state the parts share and one-line forwarders; the drag (`OrbitDrag`), hiding (`OrbitHidden`), focus, rename and Escape (`OrbitFocus`), noise control (`OrbitAnc`), the daemon's data and clock (`OrbitDaemonData`), the detail card's measures (`FocusLayout`) and the floating chrome (`OrbitChrome`) each have their own file, and the black hole's body lives with the physics that moves it. Same pictures (compared with the offscreen previews), same behaviour.
- **The remaining big files are cut by role too.** The device body (tether, charge beam, arcs, label, look, connection effects, lock ring, close button, mouse), the detail card (corner buttons, name, volumes, battery wiring, glyph picker, and its wording in a tested `CardStatus.js`), the new-device pop-up (`BackgroundScan`, `OfferQueue`, `DemoDevice`), the offscreen previews (`mock/` data) and the tests (one gjs file per role, a shared loader and a runner). Same pictures (compared with the offscreen previews), same behaviour.

## 1.12.1 - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- **Changing the volume no longer costs the whole shell.** The levels eased with QML animations, which made every shell window (bars, wallpaper) redraw at the screen's rate while the pop-up showed; they now ease on the scope's own 60 Hz clock, and the sound picture is computed once for every screen, each screen only painting it. Measured while stepping the volume three times a second, sound playing, Dank Island on two screens: the shell used **92 %** of one core with 1.12.0, **≈ 21 %** now; DMS alone, same test, uses ≈ 10 %. The rest is the live sound picture itself, drawn 60 times a second while the pop-up shows (*Light*, 30 images per second, or *None* in *Settings → Sound* make it cheaper); at rest nothing runs, as before.
- The keyboard-profile question of a new device could be skipped silently when its answer was written to an object that did not exist: the connection flow now keeps it on its own object, and a test covers it.
- Saving a level or hiding a device no longer wakes every view that reads a list setting.
- Moving the sound to another output while the scope showed could leave it on the one-band fallback until the next restart.
- The live sound no longer stutters when `cava` sends a frame a little late: the scope used to take it for silence and draw a blank step first (10 frames gave 19 pictures, now 10). Silence over an already blank picture paints nothing.

### Changed

- **The two volumes never share a colour.** When the theme's two accents look alike (a generated pink and salmon, for example), this PC's level takes the opposite hue (pink and mint), in the scope and in the folded line; distinct accents stay as they are.
- The code is split into feature folders (`components/scene`, `device`, `card`, `volume`, `pairing`, `noise`, `common`), the orbit's physics live in a pure, tested `Physics.js`, and one sound feed and picture serve every screen; see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md). The biggest files are cut by role: the scene (`Orbit.js`, connections, discovery, backdrop, world), the device body (tether, charge beam, arcs, label), the pairing sheet (stage, identity, button), the scope (grid, readouts) and the settings (one file per tab). Nothing changes on screen (every preview identical to 1.12.0).

## 1.12.0 - 2026-10-03

### Added

- **Two volumes, the device's and this PC's.** Many Bluetooth devices have a volume of their own; Orbit now keeps it apart from what this PC sends, remembers this PC's level per device, and draws both as two half circles, one inside the other, with the live sound inside (a polar vectorscope read by `cava`, only while it shows). *Settings → Sound → Separate PC volume* turns it off. A device without a volume of its own shows one level and says why.
- **Volume pop-up.** When any volume changes, a small dark screen shows both levels: in place of DMS's volume OSD (default), under the bar widget, on the right screen edge, or off. On screens with Dank Island, it shows inside the island instead. Three sizes, and four ways to draw the sound: *Points*, *Rays*, *Waves* or *None*, at 60 or 30 images per second.
- **Smart volume steps.** 1 % per slow notch, bigger steps when you scroll or press fast, and a short hold when you turn back; *Gentle*, *Balanced* or *Fast*, or a fixed step.
- **Command line**: `dms ipc call orbitBluetooth volume up | down` (smart steps), `deviceVolume` and `pcVolume` (`up`, `down`, `0`–`100`, `+N`, `-N`).
- **Volume keys with smart steps, in one click.** The first time Orbit's volume pop-up opens, one line offers it (*Smart volume keys? Enable*, with *Undo* after); also in **Settings → Sound** and `dms ipc call orbitBluetooth volumeKeys on | off | status`. Orbit asks DMS's own `dms keybinds` to bind the two keys, only if they still do DMS's default; they fall back to DMS's step if Orbit is off or gone, and *Undo* or uninstalling writes back DMS's exact line (niri only). They always change the output you hear: with the sound on a wired interface, a connected headset does not move.
- **Uninstalling leaves nothing.** DMS deletes the plugin folder but keeps its settings and widgets; Orbit now erases them itself when it finds its folder gone (settings, bar, Control Center and desktop widgets with their positions, pictures cache). It waits a few seconds and checks again, so an update that re-downloads the folder keeps everything; disabling or restarting erases nothing.

### Changed

- **Sounds moved to the new *Sound* tab** (cues, their volume and the volume tick); *Look & sound* is now *Look*.
- **In the bar pop-out and the Control Center, the card's volumes start folded** into one thin line, so the card fits without scrolling; the wheel over a level changes it, a click unfolds the scope.
- **The device card shows both volumes.** Under the device name, the same dark scope as the volume pop-up: the device's half on one side, *This PC* on the other, live sound in the middle while the card is open. Drag or scroll either half; click the planet to mute, scroll on it to change the main volume. A device whose volume follows the PC shows a short note with the GitHub mark. The aurora ring around the planet and its effects are gone, and the card leaves less empty room above the planet.

## 1.11.2 - 2026-10-03

### Changed

- **Ambient motion pauses behind windows.** When windows fill the screen (fullscreen, maximized, or several side by side), the desktop orbit freezes as if Ambient were off: nobody can see it drift. It wakes as soon as the desktop shows again (workspace change, window closed, overview). niri only; on other compositors Ambient keeps running.
- Ambient's slow drift with nobody around runs at 20 Hz instead of 30 Hz.

### Performance

- Desktop widget with *Ambient motion* on, two screens covered by windows: **3.33 % → 1.43 %** of one core for the whole shell, against 1.38 % with Orbit disabled (counter-tested: back on 1.11.1, 3.33 %; again on 1.11.2, 1.58 %).

## 1.11.1 - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Four more short notes, each with the GitHub mark that opens the matching guide section, so Orbit never fails in silence:
  - **Turn on** had no effect (Bluetooth is still off 3 s later): "Bluetooth stayed off — Airplane mode or a switch may block it".
  - **No adapter**: the "No Bluetooth adapter" line now carries the GitHub mark.
  - Scrolling on a connected device that has no volume: "<name> has no volume — It does not play sound, or its audio is not ready yet".
  - **Disconnect** that does nothing within 8 s: the planet shakes and "<name> is still connected — It may be in use: try again, or turn it off".
- Guide: new sections *If it does not disconnect* and *Bluetooth is off* (rfkill, airplane mode, the Bluetooth service).

### Fixed

- A planet whose disconnection never happened stayed stuck in the "disconnecting" state until Orbit restarted; it now returns to normal after 8 s.

## 1.11.0 - 2026-10-03

### Added

- **Volume ring**: open a connected audio device and a ring floats around its planet. Scroll for 5 % steps, drag along the ring for anything in between, click the planet to mute. The level is a band of aurora that ripples and flares as it moves; moving it leaves a comet tail and fine stardust, each step sends a sound wave off the planet (a corona at 100 %), and mute eclipses the planet. While you change it, the percentage drops into the ring's gap: digits roll on a spring and the level swings past and settles. The effects run on one 60 Hz clock, only while something moves, and are drawn light: a translucent band, dust written into fixed slots (at most 80 grains a second). Offscreen bench, 6 s of continuous drag: effects cost 0.16 s of CPU, down from 0.40 s in the first draft.
- **Volume tick** (Look & sound, on by default): a soft, short tick plays in the device itself at each 5 % step, so you can hear where you are.

### Changed

- Detail card buttons are balanced: back and change icon on the left, connect, hide and forget on the right.
- When the pairing sheet appears, the Orbit popout closes behind it instead of staying under the sheet.
- The sheet's *Connect* button is flatter and calmer: a solid accent rectangle with softly rounded corners, a hairline of light on top and a medium-weight label; the sheen and the progress bar are unchanged.

### Removed

- The volume slider of the detail card, replaced by the ring.

### Fixed

- The pairing sheet no longer redraws the whole shell while it is shown. Its scene clock and its 30 s countdown were long QML animations, which make every shell window (bars, wallpaper, both screens) repaint at the screen rate; they now run on timers (60 Hz while something moves, 30 Hz for the countdown), so only the sheet repaints. Measured with the demo sheet on screen: 67.1 % of a core down to 5.8 %, and 6 busy render threads down to 1.

## 1.10.4 - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- The sheen on the *Connecting* button no longer shows a square edge: it is a rounded pill that fades at both ends.

### Changed

- Settings are grouped into tabs (Orbit, Scanning, Headphones, Desktop, Look & sound), one shown at a time.

### Fixed

- **Pop-up for new headphones** works on its own: turning off **Offer new devices** (the card inside the Orbit view) no longer hides the pop-up without a word.

## 1.10.3 - 2026-10-02

### Added

- When pairing, connecting or noise control does not work, a short note says why and what to do, with a GitHub mark that opens the matching section of the guide (in your browser, on click only). The `anc` commands print the guide link too.

### Changed

- **Background scan** is now a separate option, **off by default**: the new-headphones pop-up listens to any search you start (free), and Orbit only scans by itself if you turn it on. Its interval and battery settings appear only then.

## 1.10.2 - 2026-10-02

### Security

- **Real device pictures** looks up only devices you have paired: the model name of a stranger's device nearby is never sent.
- A picture that arrives after you turn the option off is dropped, and turning it off erases the cache.
- The picture cache is private (folder 0700, files 0600).
- The pairing log no longer contains the device name.
- **Safe pairing**: a device is offered only when Bluetooth says it is audio, not because of its name. After pairing, Orbit checks its services before trusting it; headphones that can also send key presses (often for their buttons) wait, unable to connect, until you choose **Pair anyway**, and are forgotten otherwise. Same check when dragging a device into the orbit.
- **Real device pictures** follows a redirect only to the listed hosts, over https; its User-Agent now gives the right version.
- The noise-control helper receives the headset's name through its environment rather than its command line, which other programs can read. Both helpers ignore `PYTHON*` variables and user packages (`python3 -E -s`).
- The noise-control helper keeps at most 64 KB of an unfinished message, whatever a device sends.

### Fixed

- The pairing sheet's animation pauses while the session is locked or the screens are off.

## 1.10.1 - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- The offscreen previews (`scripts/preview/`) render again: they lacked a stand-in for PipeWire, which the volume row needs since 1.10.0.

### Changed

- Shorter files, same behaviour: the scene's chrome (pairing offer, scan chip, "Bluetooth is off") and the middle of the pairing card are now their own components. Every preview renders pixel for pixel as before.

## 1.10.0 - 2026-10-01

### Added

- **New headphones pop-up**: put headphones, earbuds or a speaker in pairing mode and a tall pairing sheet unfolds from the right end of the bar, even with Orbit closed. The device falls out of the bar along a comet trail into an orbit, floats above a planet's horizon and tilts towards the pointer, among twinkling stars and the odd shooting star. Two looks: deep space with a dark DMS theme, stratosphere with a light one; any palette works, its accent is brightened or deepened until it reads well.
- In the sheet: what you get (noise control, rated battery life, earbuds), **Connect** with live *Pair → Connect → Ready* steps, a star burst and a filling battery ring when connected, then the noise-control modes; rename the device before connecting; **Later** snoozes it 10 minutes, **Don't offer again** never offers it again; several devices stack with a "+1". <kbd>Enter</kbd> and <kbd>Escape</kbd> work while the pointer is on it. It folds back into the bar after a connection.
- Only named, unpaired audio devices; never while a window is full screen or the screen is locked.
- The sheet lines up with the bar's right end; a name typed in it is kept when you click away; a failed pairing says why (declined, wrong code, no answer, busy).
- Background scan for it: 8 s every minute (**Background scan**), skipped while Bluetooth audio is connected (scanning makes it stutter), on battery below **No background scan below** (30 %), and while the screen is off. Turn it off with **Pop-up for new headphones**.
- **Forget** in the right-click menu (click again to confirm). Forgetting a device also clears its icon choice and its *Don't offer again* mark.
- **Offer ignored devices again** button in the settings.
- IPC: `newDeviceDemo` shows the sheet with a made-up headset, `newDeviceStatus` tells whether the background scan runs or why not.
- QML scenario tests for the pop-up's logic (`tests/qml/run.sh`), with stubs for Quickshell and the DMS services; `scripts/preview/sheet.qml` renders the sheet with six test palettes, or records it.

### Changed

- New *Portable speaker* icon: a rugged capsule instead of something that looked like a cassette.
- With the pop-up on, the *Connect* card inside the orbit gives way to it.
- Real device pictures: the model name of an audio device offered by the pop-up may be looked up too (only with that option on).

## 1.9.0 - 2026-10-01

### Added

- **Real device pictures** (opt-in, off by default, uses the internet): a photo of the model replaces the icon of paired and connected devices, with its author and license under the detail card. Looked up on `commons.wikimedia.org`, then `api.sketchfab.com`; only the model name is sent, free licenses only, kept in `~/.cache/orbitBluetooth/pictures`. **Delete downloaded pictures** empties the cache. Not tested against the live services yet.

### Changed

- Privacy: the "no network" rule now has this one opt-in exception, documented in the README, the guide and the settings.

## 1.8.0 - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- A headset disconnected while in conversation mode stayed in it, with no way to turn it off. Orbit now turns conversation awareness off before it disconnects a headset, and again after a reconnection. The noise-control mode is kept as it was. Option **Turn off conversation awareness on disconnect** (on by default).

### Changed

- The *Remember conversation awareness* option and its saved per-headset choice are gone: they did the opposite of this fix.
- Nothing Ear (2) confirmed on hardware.
- Documentation split into `README.md`, `docs/GUIDE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## 1.7.1 - 2026-10-01

### Changed

- Control Center tile: named **OrbitBluetooth** instead of "Bluetooth", and the device name under it is cut at 12 characters so it stays inside the tile.

## 1.7.0 - 2026-10-01

### Added

- Offer to connect: when an unpaired, named device shows up while the view scans, a small card says so with a **Connect** button (it goes away after 12 s or with ×). Devices already around when the view opens are not offered. Turn it off with **Scanning → Offer new devices**.
- Connecting: two soft sonar rings leave the device, next to the comet. Not seen on real hardware yet.

## 1.6.0 - 2026-10-01

### Added

- Volume per device: a slider and a mute button in the detail card of a connected audio device, through PipeWire (local only). Not tested on real hardware yet.

## 1.5.0 - 2026-10-01

### Added

- Conversation awareness is remembered per headset and put back after a reconnect (option *Remember conversation awareness*, on by default).
- Silent Apple models (AirPods Max 2): Orbit asks for the state a second time, then offers the modes for *Pro* and *Max* names. Known not functional on the AirPods Max.

### Changed

- Scene chrome (scan chip, *Turn on* button, sky color) takes its sizes from the DMS theme; the night colors live in one place (`NightColors`).
- AirPods 3 and 4 confirmed on hardware.

## 1.4.1 - 2026-09-27

### Changed

- Device names are readable everywhere, even on a pale or busy wallpaper: each name glows softly in your theme's accent, and devices that are not connected fade less. On the desktop they also sit on a smoky disc.
- Desktop widget: devices are a quarter smaller, so the orbit sits lighter on the wallpaper. The panels keep their size.
- Connected devices read stronger than the others. With nothing connected, every name is lifted.

## 1.4.0 - 2026-09-26

### Added

- Rename a device: click its name in the detail card. Enter saves, Escape cancels, an empty name restores the device's own name.

### Changed

- A renamed device keeps its icon, noise control, earbuds look, battery estimate and custom pictures: they follow the name the device reports itself.

## 1.3.2 - 2026-09-26

### Changed

- The Control Center and the bar popout are as light as the desktop: nothing loops as a QML animation anywhere, the drift runs on a 30 Hz timer, and display-synced frames are only used while dragging. An open view at rest costs about 5–6 % of one core for the whole shell.
- Shooting stars are rarer (every 12–32 s), cross from the top left to the bottom right, and bend toward the black hole or get swallowed by it.

### Fixed

- A connection attempt no longer makes the whole shell redraw at the display rate.

## 1.3.1 - 2026-09-26

### Changed

- Everything pauses while the session is locked or the monitors are off; connection timers pause when nobody is looking.

### Fixed

- Desktop widget truly at rest: from about 65 % of a core to about 1 % (about 3.5 % with *Ambient motion*).
- Dragging stays smooth to the very end of the motion.

## 1.3.0 - 2026-09-26

### Added

- Light theme support: the sky stays night, devices turn white, cards use a soft white.

## 1.2.2 - 2026-09-26

### Added

- Pick the screens of the desktop widget from Orbit's settings.

### Changed

- Esc steps back one level (menu, hidden list, card) before closing the view.
- The quick-disconnect × is now an option, off by default.
- Clicking the center only reacts on its inner 70 %, never over a device.
- Settings grouped into short sections, with a note on the options that use more battery.
- The machine in the center is 15 % smaller.

## 1.2.1 - 2026-09-26

### Changed

- Charging beam redrawn as thin magnetic field lines.
- Charging earbuds move closer to the case, with their battery bar.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-09-26

### Added

- Earbuds trio: the case and both buds in their own mini orbit, each with its battery, and a beam to the bud that charges.
- Live charging state while a view is open (headset session instead of a one-off read).

### Changed

- The Control Center tile grows to the exact height of the open card.

### Fixed

- DMS's pairing dialog is shown for devices that ask for a code (fixes endless disconnects).

## 1.1.1 - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- Detail card polish: symmetric spacing, a mode pill that hugs its content.
- Noise control no longer loses the final state or flashes back to the previous mode.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-09-26

### Added

- Noise control for 13 headphone brands (tested on Sony and Huawei).
- The black hole: drag a device into it to hide it, click it to list and bring devices back; two looks.
- Right-click menu, a comet while a device connects, depth on the ring of connected devices.
- Battery time left from the moment a device connects.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-09-25

### Added

- First release: the planetary scene, drag to connect, the detail card, Control Center + bar + desktop, 28 device icons, sounds, and an option to scan only on demand.
