# Orbit Bluetooth

**A planetary Bluetooth manager for [DankMaterialShell](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell).**

Your machine sits at the center of a small star system and nearby devices float around it.
Drag a device to the center to connect it, pull it away to disconnect it.

## Getting started

### Requirements

| Dependency | Version | Needed for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DankMaterialShell | 1.6.0 or newer | Everything |
| BlueZ | Any recent version, adapter powered on | Everything |
| UPower | Any | *Optional*: real charging states |
| PipeWire | Any | *Optional*: the two volumes of audio devices (`pw-play` for the tick, `cava` for the picture of the sound) |
| Python 3 | Standard library only | *Optional*: headphone noise control |

### 1. Install

From the plugin browser: **Settings → Plugins**, search for **Orbit Bluetooth**, click *Install*. Or from a terminal:

```sh
dms plugins install orbitBluetooth
```

<details>
<summary>Manual install</summary>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lung595/orbitBluetooth ~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins/orbitBluetooth
```

Then click **Settings → Plugins → *Scan for plugins***.
</details>

### 2. Enable

In **Settings → Plugins**, turn **Orbit Bluetooth** on.

### 3. Add a widget

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Orbit Bluetooth does not replace the built-in DMS Bluetooth widget.** Nothing shows up until you **add at least one of its widgets** yourself.

| Where | How to add it |
| --- | --- |
| **Control Center** | Open the Control Center, enter **edit mode**, add the **Bluetooth** tile from *Orbit Bluetooth* |
| **Bar** | **Settings → Appearance → DankBar Layout**, add **Orbit Bluetooth** to a section |
| **Desktop** | **Settings → Desktop Widgets**, add **Orbit Bluetooth**, then move and resize it |

> [!TIP]
> To avoid two Bluetooth tiles in the Control Center, remove the built-in one in edit mode.

### 4. First steps

1. **Open the orbit** from the widget you added. Discovery starts on its own.
2. **Drag a device into the inner ring** to pair and connect it; drag it back out to disconnect.
3. **Click a device** for its detail card: battery, charging, noise control, and the two volumes of audio devices.
4. **New headphones?** Put them in pairing mode: within a minute a pairing sheet unfolds from the bar and offers to connect them, even with Orbit closed.

## Features

| Drag to connect | Energy beam while charging |
| --- | --- |
| ![Dragging earbuds to the inner ring connects them](screenshots/connect.gif) | ![A beam of energy flowing to a charging headset](screenshots/beam.gif) |

| New headphones pop-up | Dark and light themes |
| --- | --- |
| ![The pairing sheet unfolds from the bar, the headset falls into orbit and connects](screenshots/newdevice.gif) | ![The pairing sheet offering, then connected, in a dark and a light theme](screenshots/newdevice.png) |

- **New headphones? Orbit notices.** Put them in pairing mode and a pairing sheet unfolds from the bar: the headset falls into orbit and floats above a planet, *Connect* pairs it on the spot, shows its battery and its noise-control modes. Deep space in a dark theme, stratosphere in a light one, with any DMS palette. Works with Orbit closed.
- **Drag to connect** with a magnet snap, elastic tether to disconnect.
- **Two volumes**: open a connected audio device and its card shows the device's own level and this PC's as two half circles, with the sound itself moving inside. Drag or scroll each, click the planet to mute, and a soft tick plays in the device itself.
- **Volume pop-up and smart steps**: whenever a volume changes, the same screen shows both levels inside Dank Island (or in place of DMS's OSD, which is switched off); 1 % per slow notch, faster when you scroll or press fast, and your volume keys can use it in one click.
- **What really plays**: a short line under the device name and in the pop-up, for example *Bluetooth · LDAC · 96 kHz · 24 bit*, and a button that unfolds the rest.
- **Live charging**: energy beam, time to full, charge speed, session chart.
- **Earbuds trio**: the case and both buds in their own mini orbit, each with its battery.
- **Noise control** for 13 headphone brands (Sony, Apple, Samsung, Bose, Huawei…).
- **Real device pictures** (opt-in, uses the internet): a photo of your headphones, phone or TV instead of an icon.
- **Black hole**: drop a device you never use into it to hide it.
- **28 device icons** matched by name, or your own pictures.
- **Light and dark themes**; the sky always stays night.
- **Lightweight and private**: no frames drawn at rest, no telemetry, nothing leaves your machine unless you turn on real device pictures.

## Usage

| Gesture | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Put new headphones in pairing mode | A pairing sheet under the bar offers to connect them (<kbd>Enter</kbd> connects, <kbd>Esc</kbd> later) |
| Drag a device inside the inner ring | Pair and connect |
| Drag a connected device outward | Disconnect |
| Click a device | Open its detail card |
| Scroll over a half circle, its icon or its percentage, or drag a moon | That level: the device's or this PC's, with smart steps; a soft tick plays in the device every 5 % ([more](docs/GUIDE.md#the-two-volumes)) |
| Click the planet of an open audio device | Mute or unmute |
| Right-click a device | Menu: connect, noise-control modes, hide, forget |
| Forget a device (unpair) | Right-click → **Forget**, click again to confirm; or the 🗑 button of its detail card |
| Drag a device into the black hole | Hide it (it stays connected) |
| Click the black hole | List hidden devices, **Show** brings one back |
| Click the center, or the **Scan** chip | Start discovery |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Step back: menu, hidden list, detail card |

In the **Control Center**, the tile icon turns Bluetooth on or off and the arrow expands the orbit. In the **bar**, left click opens the orbit, right click turns Bluetooth on or off.

📖 Everything else (detail card, renaming, earbuds, noise control and supported models, charging data, custom icons) is in the **[user guide](docs/GUIDE.md)**.

## Command line and keybindings

```sh
dms ipc call orbitBluetooth anc nc       # nc, ambient, off or adaptive (first supported headset)
dms ipc call orbitBluetooth ancCycle     # next noise-control mode
dms ipc call orbitBluetooth ancStatus    # current noise-control state (JSON)
dms ipc call orbitBluetooth newDeviceDemo    # show the new-headphones pop-up with a made-up headset
dms ipc call orbitBluetooth newDeviceStatus  # is the background scan running, or why not
dms ipc call orbitBluetooth hidden       # list hidden devices
dms ipc call orbitBluetooth unhideAll    # bring every hidden device back
dms ipc call orbitBluetooth volume up    # up or down, with smart steps
dms ipc call orbitBluetooth deviceVolume 40  # the device's own level: up, down or 0-100
dms ipc call orbitBluetooth pcVolume -- -10  # this PC's level for it (a negative step needs --)
dms ipc call orbitBluetooth volumeKeys on    # on, off or status: your volume keys use smart steps
```

Bind them in your compositor, for example in niri: `Mod+N { spawn "dms" "ipc" "call" "orbitBluetooth" "ancCycle"; }`, or in Hyprland: `bind = SUPER, N, exec, dms ipc call orbitBluetooth ancCycle`.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Nothing changed after installing | Add one of its widgets, see [Add a widget](#3-add-a-widget) |
| After an update, Orbit's volume pop-up is gone and DMS's OSD is back (or another part of Orbit stops working) | Restart DMS once (`dms restart`, or log out and back in): a running shell does not see files an update adds, so Orbit's background service cannot start until then |
| Earbuds disconnect after a few seconds | Accept the pairing code dialog once |
| No pop-up for new headphones | It appears when any tool searches for devices (Orbit's **Scan**, your system settings); turn on **Background scan** to have Orbit search by itself; the pop-up waits for full-screen windows |
| Something did not work | A short note says why, and the GitHub mark next to it opens the matching section of the guide |
| Bluetooth is off and **Turn on** does nothing | Airplane mode or a hardware switch blocks it: `rfkill unblock bluetooth`, see [Bluetooth is off](docs/GUIDE.md#bluetooth-is-off) |
| No devices appear while scanning | Put the device in pairing mode; turn on **Show unnamed devices** |
| A device charges but shows no lightning | Wait for its first level increase: the estimate starts then |
| Noise control does not appear | Headset must be paired and supported, Python 3 installed; reopen the card |
| A device vanished | It is in the black hole: click it, or `dms ipc call orbitBluetooth unhideAll` |
| Settings or widgets of Orbit left after removing it while DMS was not running | Install it again, then remove it from DMS while it runs: it cleans up after itself, see [Uninstalling](docs/GUIDE.md#uninstalling) |
| Volume keys still use smart steps after removing Orbit while DMS was not running | They still work (they fall back to DMS); give them back: `dms keybinds set niri XF86AudioRaiseVolume "spawn dms ipc call audio increment 3" --allow-when-locked`, same with `XF86AudioLowerVolume` and `decrement`, see [Volume keys](docs/GUIDE.md#volume-keys) |
| DMS's volume OSD stays off after removing Orbit | DMS saved its settings while Orbit held that switch off: turn **Volume** back on in DMS's *Settings → On-screen Displays*, see [DMS's own volume OSD](docs/GUIDE.md#dmss-own-volume-osd) |
| Time to full looks off | Some headsets report in 10 % steps; it improves over time |

Some Sony headsets do not report charging, or drop Bluetooth while charging: this is a hardware limit.

## Privacy

- **Safe pairing.** A new device is only trusted once Orbit has checked it is what it looks like; headphones that can also send key presses (for their buttons) are paired only if you say so. [More](docs/GUIDE.md#pairing-safety)
- **No telemetry.** Connection times and battery history stay in memory; settings, hidden and ignored devices are stored by DMS.
- **Noise control**: a small helper talks to your headset over a local Bluetooth socket, only while needed.
- **New headphones pop-up**: by default Orbit only listens to searches you start yourself; nothing runs in the background. The optional **Background scan** (off by default) does a local scan of 8 s about once a minute, only while the screen is on, no Bluetooth audio is connected and the battery is above the threshold.
- **Two volumes**: talk to the local sound server (PipeWire) only; the tick is a sound file shipped with Orbit, the picture of the sound is read locally with `cava`.
- **Audio details**: read from PipeWire (`pactl list sinks`) while the card or the pop-up shows, only if a fact is chosen; kept in memory, dropped when it closes.
- **DMS's volume OSD**: while Orbit's pop-up is on, Orbit holds DMS's *Volume* switch off, in memory only, and lets go of it around each of DMS's own saves, so nothing of it reaches DMS's files. [More](docs/GUIDE.md#dmss-own-volume-osd)
- **Volume keys**: only if you click *Enable*, Orbit asks DMS (`dms keybinds`) to bind them; *Undo* and uninstalling give them back exactly. [More](docs/GUIDE.md#volume-keys)
- **Guide links**: the GitHub mark opens the guide in your browser only when you click it; Orbit itself makes no request.
- **Network: only one opt-in feature, off by default.** **Real device pictures** sends only the *model name* of devices you have paired, never a stranger's device nearby, never the Bluetooth address. It contacts `commons.wikimedia.org`, then `api.sketchfab.com`, and downloads the picture from `upload.wikimedia.org` or `media.sketchfab.com`. Pictures are credited in the card, kept in `~/.cache/orbitBluetooth/pictures` (readable by you only) and erased when you turn the option off or from the settings.

- **Uninstalling leaves nothing.** When you remove Orbit from DMS, it erases what DMS keeps for it (its settings, its bar, Control Center and desktop widgets) and its pictures cache, and your sound goes back exactly as before. [More](docs/GUIDE.md#uninstalling)

## Credits

Noise-control protocols were reimplemented from the public notes of Gadgetbridge, SonyHeadphonesClient, XMDeck, LibrePods, MagicPodsCore, GalaxyBudsClient, based-connect, bosectl, OpenSCQ30, OpenFreebuds, EarA-linux, earctl and cmfctl (no code copied). The new-device pop-up is inspired by the nearby-device cards of Google Fast Pair and Apple's AirPods setup (the idea only: Orbit uses plain BlueZ discovery, no vendor protocol). Device pictures come from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org) and [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com) (free licenses only, each author is credited in the card): thank you to the photographers and 3D artists who share their work. Built on [DankMaterialShell](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell) and [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org).
